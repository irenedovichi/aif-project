## Problem setting
### Maze solving
- Partially Observable 
- Discrete
- Non-Episodic (Sequential) 
- Single Agent, Non-Adversarial 
- Deterministic
- Static finite map: start and target coordinates are fixed

## Genetic Algorithm (1)
### Don't let children make parents' mistakes!
• Start from the two best sequences of actions (parents)
• Apply Crossover at a random index
• Stochastically mutate genes based on parenting mistakes
• Repeat until convergence!

## Genetic Algorithm (2)
### Informed mutations
• For each position i in parents' path count the number of errors and generate a vector error
• New individuals will mutate more likely where parents made huge mistakes
• Choose number of mutations based on exponential decay on generation
• Exploration - Exploitation trade off
